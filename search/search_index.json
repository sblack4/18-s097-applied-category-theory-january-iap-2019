It helps structure many subdisciplines of math, and allows these subdisciplines to communicate with each other in a shared language. We wanted to show that this structuring and interoperability extends far beyond mathematics. When people see how it can be used in databases, programming languages, resource theories, quantum information, collaborative design, systems engineering, materials science, etc., they start to see the breadth of possibilities and consider how they can be part of the research effort. They start to think \u201ccategorically.\u201d ^ David Spivak This is something I\u2019d love to see done in the sciences and humanitites. The ability to better communicate and relate findings is imperative to a holistic treatment of any difficulties. Category theory gives us a shared language much more precise than our spoken language (in my case english). I wonder what wittgenstein would have said about category theory.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#home","text":"Course notes for 18.S097: Applied Category Theory","title":"Home"},{"location":"#about","text":"See: MIT OCW site Brendon Fong\u2019s Site Video lectures on youtube","title":"About"},{"location":"#schedule","text":"from the syllabus SES # TOPICS KEY DATES 1\u20132 Chapter 1: Generative Effects: Orders and Adjunctions Problem set 1 out 3\u20134 Chapter 2: Resources: Monoidal Preorders and Enrichment 5\u20136 Chapter 3: Databases: Categories, Functors, and (Co)Limits Problem set 1 due in session 6 Problem set 2 out 7\u20138 Chapter 4: Co-design: Profunctors and Monoidal Categories 9\u201310 Chapter 5: Signal Flow Graphs: Props, Presentations, and Proofs Problem set 2 due in session 10 Problem set 3 out 11\u201312 Chapter 6: Circuits: Hypergraph Categories and Operads 13\u201314 Chapter 7: Logic of Behavior: Sheaves, Toposes, Languages Problem set 3 due in session 14","title":"Schedule"},{"location":"#instructor-insights","text":"MIT OCW page Category theory has a history of being applied in mathematics itself.
