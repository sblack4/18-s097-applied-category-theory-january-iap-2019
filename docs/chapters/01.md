[MIT OCW page](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s097-applied-category-theory-january-iap-2019/lecture-videos-and-readings/chapter-1-generative-effects-orders-and-adjunctions/)

This chapter is two video lectures. The first is like most college classes and spends some time going over the syllabus and stuff but also dives into category theory from the perspective of set theory.

## Definitions

### generative effects
Surprises that occur as a result of order not being perserved by the system.

## Notes

## Excercises 

### Exercise 1.1. 
Some terminology: a function $f: R → R$ is said to be

1. order-preserving if $x ≤ y$ implies $f(x) ≤ f(y)$, for all $x, y ∈ R$
1. metric-preserving if $|x − y| = |f(x) − f(y)|$
1. addition-preserving if $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$

For each of the three properties defined above—call it foo—find an f that is foopreserving and an example of an f that is not foo-preserving. 

??? answer
    A foo-preserving 

### Exercise 1.4. 
What is the result of joining the following two systems?

??? answer
    A fully connected system except for node 21 which is still isolated.
