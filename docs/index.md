> Category theory has a history of being applied in mathematics itself. It helps structure many subdisciplines of math, and allows these subdisciplines to communicate with each other in a shared language. We wanted to show that this structuring and interoperability extends far beyond mathematics. When people see how it can be used in databases, programming languages, resource theories, quantum information, collaborative design, systems engineering, materials science, etc., they start to see the breadth of possibilities and consider how they can be part of the research effort. They start to think “categorically.”

_^ David Spivak_

This is something I'd love to see done in the sciences and humanitites.
The ability to better communicate and relate findings is imperative to a holistic treatment of any difficulties.
Category theory gives us a shared language much more precise than our spoken language (in my case english).
I wonder what wittgenstein would have said about category theory.
